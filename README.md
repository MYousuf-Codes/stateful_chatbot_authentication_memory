# Stateful Chatbot with GitHub Authentication and Chat History

This is a stateful chatbot built with the Chainlit framework, which allows users to log in with their GitHub credentials and stores their chat history in their session. The chatbot is built with the following technology stack:

* Chainlit: a web framework for building chat applications
* GitHub Authentication: uses GitHub's OAuth API to authenticate users
* Chat History: stores the user's chat history in their session

The chatbot is built with the following features:

* User authentication with GitHub
* Stores chat history for the current session
* Chat history is stored in the user's session
* Chatbot is built with Chainlit, a web framework for building chat applications

This project is a great starting point for building a more advanced chatbot with features like user authentication and chat history.
